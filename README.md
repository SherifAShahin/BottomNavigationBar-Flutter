# BottomNavigationBar-Flutter
Hi, here you will find a bottomNavigationBar - flutter - dart  

# Note
I have used HexColor package, from https://pub.dev/packages/hexcolor/install   
and ionicons package, from https://pub.dev/packages/ionicons/install  
you have to install them first to avoid any error  

# How-To-Use
  1.Simply add the code to bottomNavigationBar: **code** inside Scaffold  
  2.Make sure you use StatefulWidget
